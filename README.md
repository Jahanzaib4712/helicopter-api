# Helicopter API üöÅ

This project was developed as part of my **Day 3 Task** for the Hackathon. The primary goal was to create a **Helicopter API** that could be integrated into my website, **HeliRoyale**. The API is designed to manage and serve helicopter data, providing users with the ability to retrieve a list of helicopters and access detailed information about specific helicopters.

## Overview

The Helicopter API is a simple yet powerful tool for managing helicopter data. It provides the following endpoints:

- **`/api/helicopters`**: Returns a list of all available helicopters.
- **`/api/helicopters/:id`**: Returns detailed information about a specific helicopter by its ID.

This API will be used in the development of my website **HeliRoyale**, which is focused on showcasing and providing information about helicopters in an interactive way. The project lays the foundation for the **HeliRoyale** website, which will present helicopter-related information to users, helping them make informed decisions when it comes to choosing the right helicopter.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Easily retrieve all helicopters or information about a specific helicopter.
- **JSON Response**: Data is returned in a clean and structured JSON format.
- **Flexible and Extendable**: The API is built with scalability in mind, allowing for easy extension to add more features in the future.

## Purpose

This API was built with the aim of completing the **Day 3 Task** of the hackathon and serves as a backend service for the **HeliRoyale** website. In the future, it will be expanded to include additional functionality such as adding, updating, and deleting helicopter data. Currently, it provides a solid foundation for displaying helicopter information, which will be a key feature of the **HeliRoyale** platform.

## How to Use

To use this API, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jahanzaib4712/helicopter-api.git

npm install
Run the server locally:

npm start
The API will be available at http://localhost:3000.

To get a list of all helicopters, navigate to /api/helicopters.

To get details of a specific helicopter by its ID, navigate to /api/helicopters/:id.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The API is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment that allows for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used for building the API's routing and middleware.
- **File System**: Data is read from a local JSON file (`helicopters.json`) to simulate a database and provide helicopter data dynamically.

## Future Plans

- **Create, Update, and Delete Helicopters**: Add functionality to allow for creating new helicopter entries, updating existing ones, and deleting them.
- **Database Integration**: Integrate a persistent database (e.g., MongoDB or MySQL) for storing helicopter data, ensuring it persists even when the server is restarted.
- **Expand API Features**: Enhance the API by adding more helicopter-related information, such as images, specs, and dynamic search capabilities.
